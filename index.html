    <p id="aboutDescription"> I'm Charlie, a rising junior at Duke University studying Computer Science, Economics,
        and Philosophy. I am a software engineer with a wide variety of interests -- from distributed systems
        to game development. My goal is to constantly learn about new subjects and schools
        of thought in order to continually develop my skills in technology.</p>

        <p class="slideDescription"> Over the course of ten weeks, nine fellow
            students and I created a game authoring application. Four separate teams were created from the larger
            group, and I was a member of the team which designed and coded our engine which would run the games made
            using
            our platform. Working on this project taught me how to work under the Agile methodology and effectively
            communicate with team members in order to construct a well-designed, flexible game environment.

        <h3 class="slideHeader"> sphereCrypt </h3>
        <p class="slideDescription"> sphereCrypt is a cryptography algorithm which I created, using a custom encryption
            /
            decryption technique. The algorithm allows string messages to be encrypted to a hex string, which can
            then be passed into the decryption scheme which will return the original message. The encryption is not
            one-to-one, meaning that the same message may be encrypted in many different ways. Despite this, it can
            always be decrypted back into the original message.

        <p class="slideDescription"> The website you are currently viewing is made entirely from scratch, not using any
            format from a course or website as a template. I designed it to be as clean and smooth as possible for the
            user, while still making the experience intuitive for those unfamiliar with the site. The transition logic
            was implemented to be flexible to support any sequence of actions and the animations made to seem natural
            regardless
            of what is happening in the back-end.
