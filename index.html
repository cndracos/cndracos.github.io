<p id="aboutDescription"> I'm a software engineer studying at Duke University with a major in Computer Science and
    minors in Economics and Philosophy. I have a wide variety of interests -- from distributed systems
    to game development. My goal is to constantly challenge myself and continue learning,
    so I can develop my skills in technology and business.</p>

        <p class="slideDescription"> Over the course of ten weeks, nine teammates and I created a game authoring program.
            Four separate teams were created from the larger group, and I was a member of the team which designed and
            coded our game engine. Working on this project taught me how to use Agile methodologies and
            effectively communicate with team members in order to construct a well-designed, flexible game environment.

        <p class="slideDescription"> sphereCrypt is a cryptography algorithm that I created and uses a custom encryption
            / decryption scheme. The algorithm generates a key which is used to decode the encoded message back into
            human readable form. The image to the left is a visualization of this process, representing a potential
            path that may be taken while the program is running.

        <p class="slideDescription"> This project was done in a group as a part of the Operating Systems course taught
            at my university, which had us write a thread library that implements thread creation, yielding, locking, and
            condition variables. In order to test our library we had to write custom test suites which checked the logic
            of our thread queues and context swaps.

        <p class="slideDescription"> I personally created the entire website you are currently viewing -- from the
            layout of the elements to the style of transitioning between them. My intention was for the experience to be
            smooth for the user while keeping use intuitive for those first visiting the site. Creating this site taught
            me how to host a web page that is accessible across all devices and platforms.
