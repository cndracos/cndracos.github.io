    <p id="aboutDescription"> I'm a software engineer studying at Duke University with a major in Computer Science and
        minors in Economics and Philosophy. I have a wide variety of interests -- from distributed systems
        to game development. My goal is to constantly challenge myself and continue learning,
        so I can develop my skills in technology and business.</p>

        <p class="slideDescription"> Over the course of ten weeks, nine teammates and I created a game authoring program.
            Four separate teams were created from the larger group, and I was a member of the team which designed and
            coded our game engine. Working on this project taught me how to use the Agile method and
            effectively communicate with team members in order to construct a well-designed, flexible game environment.

        <p class="slideDescription"> sphereCrypt is a cryptography algorithm that I created and uses a custom encryption
            / decryption scheme. The algorithm generates a key which is used to decode the encoded message back into
            human readable form. The image to the left is a visualization of this process, representing a potential
            path that may be taken while the program is running.

            smooth for the user while keeping use intuitive for those first visiting the site. Creating this site taught
            me how to host a web page that is accessible across all devices and platforms.
